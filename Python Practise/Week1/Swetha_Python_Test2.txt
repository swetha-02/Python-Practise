TEST- 2

1) Tuple Comprehension:
	No. There is no tuple comprehension it is not efficient than list comprehension.

2)list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]  
   list2=[6,7,8,9,10]
   Concatenation --> list1.extend(list2)
    Repetition --> list1*list1

3) Folder>File1>File2

     shutil.rmtree("Folder>File1>File2)

4) Doc string:
      def doc():
    	print("""i am i am 
      i am not i am when i am""")
      doc()
5) Python Namespaces:
	Namespace defines unique name for each object in python. There are three types of namespaes:
	1) Local namespaces
	2) Global namespaces
	3) Built-in namespaces

6) List: List is a type of data structure, which is mutable and ordered set of collections. List can 
be defined using []. Same data type elements only allowed in list.
	list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
     Tuple: Tuple is similar to list but the values in tuple is immutable. It is defined with ()
	tuple1=(1,2,3,4,5)
     Set: Set is defined as the collection of data with different data types. It is unordered. It is defined 
using {}.
	set1={2,3,"Swetha","Srinivasan"}
    Dictionary: Dictionary is colletion of key, value pairs of data. In dictionary, key is immutable 
where as values are mutable, it is also an ordered collection of data.
	dict1={"name":"Swetha","age":21}
7) list1=[1,2,3] list2=[1,2,3] 	
     print(list1 is list2) 
     output--> False
	Explanation:  The output of the given code is False because the id of the list1 and list2 varies.

       	       print(j,end=" ")
	print()
10) def func(n):
      for i in range(1,n+1):
         yield i
       func(5)

13) val={"name":"Swetha","age":21}
      with open("sample3.json","w") as file:
      a=json.dumps(val)
          print(a)

14) num1=int(input("Enter num1:"))
      num2=int(input("Enter num2:"))
      prod=num1*num2
      sum=num1+num2
      if prod<1000:
         print(prod)
      else:
        print(sum)
